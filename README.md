My name is Alex. I am in High School in Kansas. I am new to coding and develpment. I want to learn to code because I am very interested into computers and gaming. I feel that it would be cool to one day make my own game. Another hobby that I have besides gaming is a balloon artist or twister. I make balloon animals for birthday partys, events, and resturants. I do not have a website for my balloon work and would like to learn how to make one to show people online what I can do and give them a way to reach me.
